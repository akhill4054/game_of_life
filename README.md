# game_of_life
Simple python script to demonstrate a famous and quite interesting problem know as 'Game of Life'.

### How to run?
- Grid size (world size) is specified by 'grid_size' variable.
- Provide seed points for the first generation in this game by adding live cells' coordinates in 'seed_points' list as tuples.
  - For each tuple (x, y), 1 <= x, y <= 'grid_size'
- Specify number of generations to be generated by modifying 'generations_count' variable in the script.
- Delay between each generation can be specified by 'frame_delay_in_seconds' variable.

Once you run the script, it will start to generate each generation based on the last generation by the game's rules. World or cells on the grid will be printed on the command line/console with the delay specified by the 'frame_delay_in_seconds' variable.
- Alive cells will be printed as "#"
- Dead cells will be printed as "."
